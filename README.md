A 3D Slicer extension designed to organize and manage the work of labeling teams on the <span style="color:#fd4685">**Supervisely**</span> computer vision platform.

This extension allows you to work with Labeling Jobs just as you would on the <span style="color:#fd4685">**Supervisely**</span> platform, but within the familiar environment of 3D Slicer. Labeling Jobs is a powerful tool for efficiently organizing and distributing data annotation tasks within a team. It ensures annotators work on well-defined portions of the dataset, follow consistent guidelines, and contribute to the project's success while maintaining data quality and accuracy. It's a critical component of effective team coordination in data annotation efforts.

You can read more about Labeling Jobs in our blog post [Mastering Labeling Jobs: Your Ultimate Guide](https://supervisely.com/blog/labeling-jobs/).

## Dependencies

The functionality of this extension relies on utilizing the [Supervisely Python SDK](https://supervisely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which, in turn, requires:

- **Python 3.8** or later.
- **3D Slicer 5.4.0** or later.
- An active **Internet Connection**

## Labeling Jobs Annotating Module Preview

This module enables annotators to annotate with all the conveniences and submit annotated data to the platform, set statuses for completed volumes, and submit Labeling Jobs for review.

## Labeling Jobs Reviewing Module Preview

This module allows reviewers to make changes to annotations, accept or reject the work done by annotators, and restart or complete Labeling Jobs.

## Basic Tutorial

The tutorial assumes that you already have the module **ConnectToSupervisely** installed.

1. If you are new to <span style="color:#fd4685">**Supervisely**</span>, please learn how our platform works and start at [this point](https://docs.supervisely.com/).
   <br>
   You can also find a lot of useful information on our [Blog](https://supervisely.com/blog/) and on the [Developer Portal](https://developer.supervisely.com/).
   <br>
   In short, you need to organize Team and Workspace, create Project, import volume data, and create Labeling Job.

   [Video explanation of how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwNHbvyZL7Q)

2. Go to the 3D Slicer and navigate to the "Supervisely" section in the list of available modules.
   <br>
   Select the required module.
   <br>
   You can also search by pressing `CTRL+F` on your keyboard.

3. You need to authorize on the server you are working with.
   <br>
   To do this, fill in all fields and click `Connect`.

   Here you can specify on which <span style="color:#fd4685">**Supervisely**</span> server your data is located, as well as enter account credentials to connect to the server.
   <br>
   <img src="./Images/auth.png" style="width:400px">
   <br>
   If you are using the Community Edition instance - use [app.supervisely.com](https://app.supervisely.com/) server address. <span style="color:#fd4685">**Supervisely**</span> Enterprise users use their instance addresses.

   You can save your authentication by ticking `Remember login` checkbox,

   <img src="./Images/auth_r.png" style="width:400px">
   <br>
   or you can remain logged in for this work session only.

4. Select the Team in which Labeling Jobs are waiting for you to annotate. Only the Teams you are a member of will be listed.

5. Select Labeling Job from the list. Only those Jobs whose status is `Pending` or `In progress`, and you are the annotator for them, are displayed in the list.
   <br>
   You can update the list of available Jobs for the current Team at any time by clicking `Refresh Jobs List`, it won't reset your current workflow.

6. Click `Start Labeling`.
   <br>
   The data will be downloaded from the server and saved in the `Working directory` which can be adjusted in the Settings section.
   <br>
   During the process, you can use the `Sync Job` button to synchronize with the server:

   - agree to save the current state, then only the modified annotation objects in 3D Slicer (number `3` in the image below) will overwrite the state of the same objects on the server, all other objects will keep their states
   - refuse to save, then all changes made in 3D Slicer will be reset and the user will receive an updated Labeling Job
     <br>
     ‚òùÔ∏è Not to forget that if new classes or tags have been added to the project, they should be added in the Labeling Job settings.

7. Select the Volume you want to work with. Segmentations will be automatically created to represent classes of annotation objects.

   ![Supervisely representation in 3D Slicer](./Images/subject_hierarchy.png)
   <br>

   - `1` Volume: `CTChest.nrrd`
     <br>
   - `2` Supervisely Class: `Tumor` ‚Üí Slicer Segmentation: `Tumor`
     <br>
   - `3` Supervisely Annotation Object: `Tumor` ‚Üí Slicer Segment: `Tumor`
     <br>
     ü§ì object name is always the same as the class name

8. To create a new annotation object, simply select any of the Segmentation and add a new Segment. When creating objects, it is not necessary to name them and change their color, as they will be converted to class names and colors once they are uploaded to the server. If during the creation process, you need to change the name or color for convenience, you can do so without worrying about how it will be saved.

9. Add the necessary tags for Volume.

   <img src="./Images/active_job.png" style="width:400px">

   This tab `Tags` won't be activated if there aren't any tags. The availability of tags depends on the settings of the Labeling Job.

10. If your work on this Volume is complete, click the `Mark as Done` button. This will save your work and designate the Volume with the necessary status, which will help to realize that the annotation of this Volume is complete.

11. Once the work in this Labeling Job is complete, click on the `Submit for review` button. The current Labeling Job will change status to `On review` and drop from the list of available jobs. It is now ready for the review process.

## Module Settings and Options

### Remember login

The information with the server address and the account token received at the first login is saved to a `.env` file for further simplified connection to the platform.

### Ignore Segment status on Save

When this setting is checked (default), all segments will be saved regardless of their status.
<br>
Otherwise, segments with the status `Completed` will be saved, and segments with the status `In progress` will initiate a save request.
<br>
Segments with all other statuses will not be saved, but their current state in the current scene not change. To reset their state you will need to change the current Volume to another one and get back. Or reload the current Labeling Job. (Local reset will be added in the future)

‚ö†Ô∏è Deleted segments are deleted on save regardless of settings and statuses.

<img src="./Images/segment_status.png" style="width:800px">

### Auto save when changing Volume

This setting allows you not to lose changes if you switch between Volumes and forget to save manually.

### Auto save on "Submit for review"

`Annotation module only`

This setting automates saving (by pressing the button manually) at the moment when you are going to send the Labeking Job for review, having finished working on the last Volume. If you have made some changes after the previous save, but want to send it for review without these last changes - uncheck the checkbox before that.

### Restart Job with only rejected volumes

`Review module only`

There are two options for restarting the Job:

1. By default, it restarts the Job only with those Volumes that are marked as `Rejected`.
2. When the current setting is off, it automatically marks all unmarked Volumes (all that are not marked `Accepted` or `Rejected`) as `Rejected` and restarts the job like the first option.

### Working directory

The user can configure the working directory where data will be stored locally when working with the Labeling Job.

## Release Notes

#### v0.0.1 - v0.0.4

‚òùÔ∏è Does not support:

- recording statistics
- any other shapes except `Mask 3D`
- two-way auto synchronization with the Project and Labeling Job changes on the server, which means that all synchronizations have to be done manually from the 3D Slicer
